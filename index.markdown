Hello! My name is Avin Zarlez. My pronouns are She/Her or They/Them. I’m a proud parent of two, a board game enthusiast, and an advocate for diversity and inclusion. I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. In my free time, I enjoy storytelling, cooking, music, and other activities that inspire.

## Professional Background

I have the privilege of working at Arm as Staff Developer Evangelist. I work at the intersection of technology, community, and innovation. I thrive on empowering developers to create and innovate. I believe that interactive software is a powerful art form. I’m also an accomplished public speaker. I have presented at many major industry events and countless tech meetups across the U.S.

### Career History

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work on exciting projects. After graduating from college, I co-founded Yobonja. An indie game studio best known for the game _Blast Monkeys_, which was the #1 Android app for over six months in 2011.

In 2013, I joined Microsoft as a Technical Evangelist. There I helped developers leverage Microsoft platforms and technology. I solved developer's technical challenges, build prototypes and write production code. I gained deep insights into Microsoft tools, services, and platforms. I had the privilege of speaking to thousands of students and developers.

Eventually, I became a Senior Software Engineer within the Industrial Solutions Engineering team. I helped Microsoft invest in top customers and partners in a variety of industries. Solving their critical business needs and training developers in industry-leading engineering best practices.

I also ran a solo venture, PlayPerro, from 2012 to 2024. There I experimented with interactive experiences. My game _#DanceTogether_ was featured at IndieCade and the Experimental Gameplay Workshop.
