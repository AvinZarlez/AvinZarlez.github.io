## Career History

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work on exciting projects. After graduating from college, I co-founded Yobonja. An indie game studio best known for the game _Blast Monkeys_, which was the #1 Android app for over six months in 2011.

In 2013, I joined Microsoft as a Technical Evangelist. There I helped developers leverage Microsoft platforms and technology. I solved developer's technical challenges, build prototypes and write production code. I gained deep insights into Microsoft tools, services, and platforms. I had the privilege of speaking to thousands of students and developers.

Eventually, I became a Senior Software Engineer within the Industrial Solutions Engineering team. I helped Microsoft invest in top customers and partners in a variety of industries. Solving their critical business needs and training developers in industry-leading engineering best practices.

I also ran a solo venture, PlayPerro, from 2012 to 2024. There I experimented with interactive experiences. My game _#DanceTogether_ was featured at IndieCade and GDC's Experimental Gameplay Workshop.
