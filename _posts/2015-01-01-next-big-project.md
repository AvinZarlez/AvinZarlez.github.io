Welcome to 2015!

A lot of people have been asking me, what projects have you been working on lately? With the new year, I figured now is as good of time as any to announce my next big project.

I have a couple projects in the works, such as a few different game prototypes I''m experimenting with. But there is one main project I''ve been focusing most of my time and efforts on.

I''ve been working on it with my wife, Noemi. Here is a current progress screenshot:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-99641 size-full" src="/assets/2015/01/GONZALEZ_MONICA_3.jpg?resize=640%2C459" alt="my next big project" width="640" height="459" srcset="/assets/2015/01/GONZALEZ_MONICA_3.jpg?w=640 640w, /assets/2015/01/GONZALEZ_MONICA_3.jpg?resize=300%2C215 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" />We''re told 70% chance of a girl, although we won''t know for sure for another 7 weeks.

**UPDATE:** Confirmed, she''ll be a girl!
