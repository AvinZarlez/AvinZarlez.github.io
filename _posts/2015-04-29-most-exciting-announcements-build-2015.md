Build 2015 is happening right now, and Microsoft has made some cool announcements!

You can read the [results of my live retweeting](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/build-2015-announcements/) right here.

Here is what I am personally most excited about:<!--more-->

# Visual Studio

Microsoft has the best in class tools for **every** developer!

## Deeper Game Engine Support

While not a Build 2015 announcement, I want to highlight that a few weeks ago Microsoft announced a deeper partnership with three of the biggest game engines. [Unity](http://unity3d.com/ "Unity3D"), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/ "Unreal Engine"), and [Cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d.org/ "Cocos2d").

## Visual Studio Code

Today at Build, we announced a brand new editor: "Visual Studio Code"

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103311" src="/assets/2015/04/VisualStudioCode.png?resize=660%2C370" alt="Visual Studio Code" width="660" height="370" srcset="/assets/2015/04/VisualStudioCode.png?w=954 954w, /assets/2015/04/VisualStudioCode.png?resize=300%2C168 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I am very excited for this! Visual Studio is great, but sometimes you want a lightweight simplified editor to quickly navigate and edit code.

Now, not only are we offering a new, powerful and **free** solution, but it runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux right out of the box! Best of all, it will be available later today on [VisualStudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Visual Studio Website")!

# Universal Windows Platform

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103321" src="/assets/2015/04/WindowStoreUniversalWindowsPlatform.png?resize=600%2C300" alt="Window Store Universal Windows Platform" width="600" height="300" srcset="/assets/2015/04/WindowStoreUniversalWindowsPlatform.png?w=600 600w, /assets/2015/04/WindowStoreUniversalWindowsPlatform.png?resize=300%2C150 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

## Build once, run everywhere

With Windows 8, we had the "Universal Apps" that ran on both Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. With Windows 10, we now have the "Universal Windows Platform"

In Windows 10, you will build one app that can run on all Windows 10 devices. Desktops, tablets, phones, xbox, even HoloLens!

## Java, C++ and Objective-C on Windows

There are many ways to write Universal Windows Platform (or UAP) apps. Today Microsoft announced that in addition to Web apps and Win32 apps, you can use your Android Java/C++ or iOS Objective-C code to make Windows 10 apps.

You can read more about Universal Windows Platform Bridges here: <https://dev.windows.com/en-US/uwp-bridges>

# Microsoft Edge

Microsoft announced the official name of the browser we''ve been calling "Spartan" - Microsoft Edge!

Watch the video here:

# HoloLens

Lastly, we got a chance to see more of the new HoloLens!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103331" src="/assets/2015/04/HoloLens.png?resize=660%2C413" alt="Build 2015 HoloLens Announcements" width="660" height="413" srcset="/assets/2015/04/HoloLens.png?w=1024 1024w, /assets/2015/04/HoloLens.png?resize=300%2C188 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

They had some really impressive demos. My favorite was the uses for medical students.

The students of tomorrow are going to be able to visualize concepts easier than anyone has ever before.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103341" src="/assets/2015/04/HoloLens.jpg?resize=599%2C332" alt="Build 2015 HoloLens Demo" width="599" height="332" srcset="/assets/2015/04/HoloLens.jpg?w=599 599w, /assets/2015/04/HoloLens.jpg?resize=300%2C166 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

I am really looking forward to being able to try HoloLens myself. (So far, sadly, I have not.) If you happen to be at Build over the next couple of days, you can try it for yourself!

Lastly, it''s been officially announced that Unity will support the HoloLens! Read more about that on the Unity blog: <http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/04/29/announcing-support-for-microsoft-hololens/>

I am very proud to be working for Microsoft, and I am extremely happy with all of today''s announcements.
