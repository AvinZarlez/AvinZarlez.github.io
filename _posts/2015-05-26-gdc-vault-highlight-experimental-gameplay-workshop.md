Part six in my series of highlighting free talks from Game Developers Conference 2015!

### What is the GDC Vault?

The [GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/) is a collection of (most of the) talks at various GDC events. Talks from last March''s GDC 2015 are online and you can watch them when ever you want! If you have an all access, speaker or media badge you get access to the complete vault. Otherwise, there is an extra charge. However, each year they release certain [talks for free](http://www.gdcvault.com/free/gdc-15). I wanted to highlight some of my favorite talks from this year that are available for everybody to watch for free.

### Experimental Gameplay Workshop

The [GDC Microtalks](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-gdc-microtalks-2015/) are a highlight, but the <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021964/Experimental-Gameplay" target="_blank">Experimental Gameplay Workshop</a> is always an absolute must watch.

Game developers from all walks of life <a href="http://www.experimental-gameplay.org/" target="_blank">submit their most crazy, interesting, and/or never seen before game prototypes</a> months in advance, and the best of the best get showcased during this session.

The games range from the wacky and silly, to extremely serious. I dare you not to feel something when Ryan Green talks about "<a href="http://thatdragoncancer.com/" target="_blank">That Dragon, Cancer</a>" With [my daughter](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/01/next-big-project/ "Next big project") about to be born, I honestly don''t know if I can handle actually playing through that game when it comes out. But I''ll try.

If you want to get inspired to create a new idea, this is the session to watch!

<a href="http://www.tobiahmarks.com/contact/" target="_blank">Let me know</a> which game you thought was most interesting!

### What other talks would you recommend?

For GDC 2015 I''ve recommended the following talks:

  * "[game < design](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-game-design/)" by Stone Librande
  * "[Keep Grooving: Life Musings & Live Musics](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-keep-grooving-life-musings-live-musics/)" by Teddy Diefenbach and Rich Vreelandwhich
  * The [GDC Microtalks](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-gdc-microtalks-2015/)
  * "[We Suck at Inclusivity](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-we-suck-at-inclusivity/)" by Rami Ismail.
  * "[Overcoming Analysis Paralysis: Experimenting with Bears vs. Art](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/05/gdc-vault-highlight-overcoming-analysis-paralysis/)" byÂ Luke Musecat

All of these talks are available for free. My own talk however, "[Best Practices for Small Studios](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021832/Best-Practices-for-Small-Studios)", is sadly not. You''ll need access to the full GDC Vault to watch it.

In addition to these recommendations you can check out my daily GDC summaries to hear about the talks that I attended in person: [Day One](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-one/ "GDC 2015 Day One") - [Day Two](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-two/ "GDC 2015 Day Two") - [Day Three](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-three/ "GDC 2015 Day Three") - [Day Four](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-four/ "GDC 2015 Day Four") - [Day Five](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-five/ "GDC 2015 Day Five")

Have any favorite talks from the GDC Vault? [I''d love to hear about them](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/contact/ "Contact")!
