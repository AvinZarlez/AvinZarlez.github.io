Part seven in my series of highlighting free talks from Game Developers Conference 2015!

### What is the GDC Vault?

The [GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/) is a collection of (most of the) talks at various GDC events. Talks from last March''s GDC 2015 are online and you can watch them when ever you want! If you have an all access, speaker or media badge you get access to the complete vault. Otherwise, there is an extra charge. However, each year they release certain [talks for free](http://www.gdcvault.com/free/gdc-15). I wanted to highlight some of my favorite talks from this year that are available for everybody to watch for free.

### Less is More: Designing Awesome AI

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103581" src="/assets/2015/05/LessIsMoreAIGDC15.jpg?resize=660%2C264" alt="Less Is More: Designing Awesome AI GDC Vault 2015" width="660" height="264" srcset="/assets/2015/05/LessIsMoreAIGDC15.jpg?w=846 846w, /assets/2015/05/LessIsMoreAIGDC15.jpg?resize=300%2C120 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022104/Less-is-More-Designing-Awesome)<!--more-->

During the Indie Summit, game developer Kimberly Voll described her process for <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022104/Less-is-More-Designing-Awesome" target="_blank">creating awesome AI</a>.

She first went over general AI best practices and concepts, and then she described how she applied those concepts into her game <a href="http://www.rocketsrocketsrockets.com/" target="_blank">ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS. </a>The game recently came out, so you can play it yourself while listening to her talk!

### What other talks would you recommend?

For GDC 2015 I''ve recommended the following talks:

  * "[game < design](http://www.OLDURL/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-game-design/)" by Stone Librande
  * "[Keep Grooving: Life Musings & Live Musics](http://www.OLDURL/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-keep-grooving-life-musings-live-musics/)" by Teddy Diefenbach and Rich Vreelandwhich
  * The [GDC Microtalks](http://www.OLDURL/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-gdc-microtalks-2015/)
  * "[We Suck at Inclusivity](http://www.OLDURL/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-we-suck-at-inclusivity/)" by Rami Ismail.
  * "[Overcoming Analysis Paralysis: Experimenting with Bears vs. Art](http://www.OLDURL/2015/05/gdc-vault-highlight-overcoming-analysis-paralysis/)" by Luke Musecat
  * The [GDC Experimental Gameplay Workshop](http://www.OLDURL/2015/05/gdc-vault-highlight-experimental-gameplay-workshop/)

All of these talks are available for free. My own talk however, "[Best Practices for Small Studios](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021832/Best-Practices-for-Small-Studios)", is sadly not. You''ll need access to the full GDC Vault to watch it.

In addition to these recommendations you can check out my daily GDC summaries to hear about the talks that I attended in person: [Day One](http://www.OLDURL/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-one/ "GDC 2015 Day One") - [Day Two](http://www.OLDURL/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-two/ "GDC 2015 Day Two") - [Day Three](http://www.OLDURL/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-three/ "GDC 2015 Day Three") - [Day Four](http://www.OLDURL/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-four/ "GDC 2015 Day Four") - [Day Five](http://www.OLDURL/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-five/ "GDC 2015 Day Five")
