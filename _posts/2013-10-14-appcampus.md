I just learned about this program and thought some of you might be interested.

<a title="AppCampus" href="http://www.appcampus.fi/" target="_blank">AppCampus</a> is a program run by Aalto University in Espoo, Finland to help developers create apps for mobile. It''s sponsored by Microsoft and Nokia, and is taking applications from people all over the world.

Developers can receive $27,000, $68,000, or $95,000 in funding to help develop their app ideas. <a title="AppCampus" href="http://www.appcampus.fi/" target="_blank">AppCampus</a> won''t take any owner or equity for this investment, they just require that your app be exclusive to Windows Phone/Nokia Store for the first 90 days. (Afterwards can release cross platform everywhere else)

Cool program, I would encourage you to submit an application! Never know if you''ll get selected and can get some funding to help out your development.
