I''ve been talking about [GameMaker](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/tag/gamemaker/ "GameMaker on Tobiah's Blog") a lot lately it seems, with their [free offer for Standard](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2013/11/gamemaker-studio-standard-free-limited-time/ "GameMaker Studio Standard Free for a limited time!") and [$25 upgrade to professional](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2013/12/upgrade-gamemaker-studio-standard/ "$25 Upgrade GameMaker Studio Standard to Professional"). Now they continue the good news with the announcement of a <a title="GameMaker Debugger" href="http://yoyogames.com/tech_blog/35" target="_blank">proper GameMaker Debugger</a> in the upcoming 1.3 release.



The ability to add breakpoints is huge, and will greatly speed up development when you have that weird bug/issue and you can''t quite figure out what''s wrong.

This was one of the major limitations of GameMaker as a platform, and now that is one less valid excuse to ignore it as a viable professional development tool.

When can I use the GameMaker Debugger?

Unfortunately, it''s still early and development, and doesn''t support builds for native Windows 8 yet. Although you can always test on normal Windows Desktop and work out the major gameplay issues first before trying to export to Windows 8.

No word yet on when this will be released as part of the "stable" build channel. Hopefully soon!
