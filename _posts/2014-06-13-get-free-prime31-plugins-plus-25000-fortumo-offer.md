Thanks to a deal between Microsoft and Prime31, you can get FREE Prime31 Windows Store and Windows Phone plugins until July 2015.<!--more-->

This deal applies to the following [Windows 8 plugins](https://prime31.com/plugins):

Microsoft Store Plugin
  
Metro Essentials Plugin
  
Microsoft Ads Plugin
  
Microsoft Azure Plugin

As well as the following [Windows Phone Plugins](https://prime31.com/plugins):

Microsoft Store Plugin
  
Microsoft Ads Plugin
  
Windows Pone Essentials Plugin

This should help out lots of Unity developers in making and porting their apps to the Windows platforms.

I am especially looking forward to using the [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) plugin. Should make it easier to add some cool web and cloud services to my Unity projects. I get $150 a month off my bill because I’m a member of [BizSpark](http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/), and I haven’t been using nearly that much.

Do you want to become a member of [BizSpark](http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/) as well to try Azure/reduce your monthly hosting bill? If your software/app company is less than 5 years old and making less than 1 million a year, [send me an email](http://www.OLDURL/contact/)! I can help get you set up.

Fortumo allows your mobile customers to pay for in app purchases through carrier billing. This is important because a good number of customers out there either don’t have or don’t want to use a credit card, so offering an alternative will increase your potential customer base.

Fortumo recently released their Unity plugin for Windows 8 and Windows Phone. But, they know that it might take some work to integrate carrier billing properly into your app. Because of that, they are willing to pay you **[up to $25,000 to integrate it within your app](http://fortumo.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=71520e00d320aedffbc50912d&id=c08f856f32&e=b826b3779c)**! That’s pretty awesome.

Check out [their website](http://fortumo.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=71520e00d320aedffbc50912d&id=c08f856f32&e=b826b3779c) for more details of this offer.

That’s a lot of free stuff. Enjoy!
