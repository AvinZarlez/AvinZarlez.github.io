I had the opportunity to speak at “[One for All: Designing a Better Future with Inclusive Design](http://siliconvalleyforum.com/event/one-for-all-building-a-better-future-with-inclusive-design/)” this week, and Silicon Valley Forum did [an excellent write-up](https://siliconvalleyforum.com/us-building-better-future-inclusive-design/) on the event on their blog.

Check it out, some great advice:

Thank you to Silicon Valley Forum for giving me the opportunity to speak!
