Yesterday was the first day of the main conference at GDC 2014.

This was the first day the expo floor was open. As always, there was a lot going on on the show floor.<!--more-->

### What I did

It has been a while since I did not go to any of the talks. It was nice to be able to explore the show floor without trying to rush through to make my next talk. I can take more time to talk and get to know some of the people presenting.

I also got a chance to see some of the other things to do at GDC besides the expo. There was a cool game show for game developers, and a lot of Indies and small companies showing off their games.

I however missed one of my normal staples: The Independent Games Festival and Game Developers Choice Awards. The show is always fun and a highlight, but sadly I had a meeting and was unable to make it. I have heard that the show is live streamed, anyone know of a way to watch it afterwards?

### Today''s plan

I will continue to explore the show and talk to more people. I also will be working the Microsoft booth in the morning, come say hi as you walk by at the South Hall entrance!
