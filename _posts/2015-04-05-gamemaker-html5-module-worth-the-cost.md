Time for a quick “[Ask Tobiah](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/category/tips-and-tricks/ask-tobiah/)“:

> Hello, I was researching the logistics of creating a Game. I would like to become an Indie Game Developer, and I was wondering if you think the GameMaker Modules (specifically HTML5 Module) is worth the cost of it. It''s now on sale for $149.99 (includes the 25% discount). I have been writing code to create websites, but does the HTML5 Module do more than just put the head and body tags in place? (One book I read has <10 lines of code that surrounds the Flash Animation so it''s easy to put a Flash Animation in HTML5 webpage). In other words: Would it be impossible or very difficult to export a game to HTML5 without the module? Another question: Do you have a list of websites to contact so that you can license your game to them after you create a game? I am new at this. Most of my experience is in writing code for websites. Thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.

Hi Trang. Personally, I think <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/studio" target="_blank">GameMaker </a>is worth the money. It''s a great prototyping tool, and really great if you''re new to game development. It''s a harder argument now that [Unity is free](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/unity-5-announcements/ "Unity 5 Announcements"), but that doesn''t change that I think the tool is well worth the cost.

In order to run in a browser though, you will need to buy the GameMaker HTML5 module. Normally, GameMaker creates a Win32 .exe, can''t just include it in a page like you would a flash file. If your goal is to make games that run in the browser, you''ll just have to factor in the cost.

For your second question, not sure what you mean by "license". Do you mean selling the game to gamers, or selling the source code? There are many sites that do both. Which one you should use depends a lot on what kind of game you have.

For gamers, different sites have different audiences. Find the ones that has players who would be into your kind of game. Unless you''re getting a good offer/promotion/something, try releasing to as many sites as possible to increase exposer. Though you may want to make sure you have some sort of news or notification system to know where your game ends up (if it gets copied) and if there are updates/they aren''t playing the latest greatest version.

For selling code, the clear choice would be the [GameMaker Markplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/).

Hope that answers your questions! I would also recommend checking out my [resources page](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/resources/ "Resources for Game and App Developers") for other good links, and listening to other developers journeys on my [Be Indie Now](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/beindienow/ "Be Indie Now") podcast.
