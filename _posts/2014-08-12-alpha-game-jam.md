excerpt: |
  Time for a new Game Jam! The Indie Game Developers of Silicon Valley meetup.com group will host "Alpha Game Jam" at Microsoft's SF Campus on September 12th-14th.
  
  Instead of just the normal monthly meetup, we wanted to do an event that encourages developers of all skill levels to get together, learn form each other, try out something they have never done before... or just simply have fun making a new prototype.

Instead of just the normal monthly meetup, we wanted to run an event that encourages developers of all skill levels to get together, learn from each other, try something they have never done before&#8230; or just simply have fun making a new prototype.

There will be no strict rules on what kind or game you should make, or how you should make it. Bring an idea, or create one on the spot. Meet new teammates, or have your team all ready to go. All experience levels welcome, from newbies to veteran devs.

To sign up, go to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Indie-Game-Developers-of-Silicon-Valley/" target="_blank">Indie Game Developers of Silicon Valley</a> meetup.com page and RSVP. We will be using ChallengePost for the hackathon, and you can preregister there <a href="http://alphagamejam.challengepost.com" target="_blank">by going here</a>.

One thing to note, this will NOT be an overnight event. We jamming until midnight each night, returning at 10am the next morning.

Spread the word, and I hope to see you there in San Francisco on September 12th!
