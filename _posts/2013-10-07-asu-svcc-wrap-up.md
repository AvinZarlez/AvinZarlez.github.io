Last week I had the honor of guest lecturing for CIS105 at Arizona State University.

Students created their own apps for Windows Phone 8 and submitted them to the real Windows Phone store. It was cool helping them sign up for <a title="DreamSpark" href="https://www.dreamspark.com/" target="_blank">DreamSpark</a> and go through the entire development process in just a matter a days. Very inspiring considering most students had not done any kind of development before.

My favorite part was hearing student''s questions after the lectures. There were some good ones! I hope some of the students felt inspired to continue learning about programming and app development.

As soon as I landed back home in the bay area, I went to straight to Foothill College for <a title="Silicon Valley Code Camp" href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Code Camp</a>.

I''ve never been before, and I am glad I got the opportunity to. It was a fun event with a very diverse variety of people, from students just starting out to experienced industry veterans.

I didn''t get to go to as many talks as I would have liked, but I got to hang out at the Microsoft booth for a bit and talk with people. We had a few different Microsoft devices for people to play with, and let people know about some of our resources such as <a title="App Builder" href="aka.ms/startbuilding" target="_blank">App Builder</a>, <a title="Microsoft Virtual Academy" href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com" target="_blank">MVA</a>, <a title="Dreamspark" href="https://www.dreamspark.com/" target="_blank">DreamSpark</a> and <a title="BizSpark" href="https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/" target="_blank">BizSpark</a>.

I had planned to just go Saturday and take Sunday off to rest, but I ended up making it back there for a couple of hours on Sunday just because I enjoyed myself so much the day before.

I definitely look forward to the next time I get to visit ASU, and will make plans to attend <a title="Silicon Valley Code Camp" href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/" target="_blank">SVCC</a> 2014!
