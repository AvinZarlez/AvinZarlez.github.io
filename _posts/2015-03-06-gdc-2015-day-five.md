Today is Friday, and we''ve reached the last day GDC 2015. As always, it''s been a wonderful time. I''m on the CalTrain now heading back home now, so time for my summary of my last day.

## Friday, GDC 2015 Day Five

I spent most of my time in the expo. I wanted to have a chance to talk to a few of the exhibitors.

Sadly, the Stanly Parable talk I wanted to go to was full, so I went off to play some board games instead. In the west hall on the third floor they had an area with some board games being shown off, one of which was "One Night Werewolf"

"One Night Werewolf" is just like a normal game of Werewolf, only it lasts one night. It''s really that simple, and I can''t believe how well it works. There is a lot of bluffing, role switching (so you aren''t 100% sure who you are), and the game is timed to last exactly 5 minutes. I plan to get a copy for myself right away!

Then I went to my last session of GDC 2015, the Experimental Gameplay Workshop. There a bunch of game developers took turns showing off their incredible games. Some were educational, some made you get up and move around, some told amazing personal stories, and some were just plain weird.

I feel like I couldn''t do them all justice to try to describe them. Watching Ryan describe "[That Dragon, Cancer](http://thatdragoncancer.com/)" brought me to tears. Now that I have [my own daughter](http://www.OLDURL/2015/01/next-big-project/ "Next big project") on the way, I don''t know how I am going to handle going through that game.

Here is a list of the people who presented, you should check out their work for yourself at your own pace, they''re amazing:

## Final Summary

I don''t go to as many sessions as I have in earlier years, now that I have access to the vault. I''ve prioritized meeting and talking with other developers. I still got to see a few though! Funny enough, my favorite this year was the very first one I saw: "Scroll Back: The Theory and Practice of Cameras in Side-Scrollers". Such a great history of cameras in 2d games.

I am looking forward to getting the feedback from [my talk](http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/best-practices-for-small-studios-outmaneuver-your-competition). I hope everybody there liked it! I''ll let you all know when you can get it on the vault.

2014 was one of the best years of my life, but also the absolute most busiest. I released fewer games than at any other point in my adult life. GDC has motivated me to be better at fixing that.

Thank you again to all the wonderful people I''ve met or reconnected with this year. Feel free to contact me anytime if you ever have a question, or if there is anything I can do to help you out.

See you all at GDC 2016!
