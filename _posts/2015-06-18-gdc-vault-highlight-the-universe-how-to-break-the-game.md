Part eight in my series of highlighting free talks from Game Developers Conference 2015!

### What is the GDC Vault?

The [GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/) is a collection of (most of the) talks at various GDC events. Talks from last March''s GDC 2015 are online and you can watch them when ever you want! If you have an all access, speaker or media badge you get access to the complete vault. Otherwise, there is an extra charge. However, each year they release certain [talks for free](http://www.gdcvault.com/free/gdc-15). I wanted to highlight some of my favorite talks from this year that are available for everybody to watch for free.

### The Universe: How To Break The Game

What if we looked at the universal the same way we look at games?

Dain Saint from Cipher Prime gave a really beautiful ["Cosmos-inspired" talk](http://gdcvault.com/play/1022326/The-Universe-How-To-Break) doing just that.

This talk is worth watching for his slides alone. Extremely good art and transitions.

Check it out for yourself here: <http://gdcvault.com/play/1022326/The-Universe-How-To-Break>

### What other talks would you recommend?

For GDC 2015 I''ve recommended the following talks:

  * "[game < design](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-game-design/)" by Stone Librande
  * "[Keep Grooving: Life Musings & Live Musics](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-keep-grooving-life-musings-live-musics/)" by Teddy Diefenbach and Rich Vreelandwhich
  * The [GDC Microtalks](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-gdc-microtalks-2015/)
  * "[We Suck at Inclusivity](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-we-suck-at-inclusivity/)" by Rami Ismail.
  * "[Overcoming Analysis Paralysis: Experimenting with Bears vs. Art](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/05/gdc-vault-highlight-overcoming-analysis-paralysis/)" by Luke Musecat
  * The [GDC Experimental Gameplay Workshop](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/05/gdc-vault-highlight-experimental-gameplay-workshop/)
  * [Less is More: Designing Awesome AI](http://wp.me/p3X06x-qWv) By Kimberly Voll

All of these talks are available for free. My own talk however, "[Best Practices for Small Studios](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021832/Best-Practices-for-Small-Studios)", is sadly not. You''ll need access to the full GDC Vault to watch it.

In addition to these recommendations you can check out my daily GDC summaries to hear about the talks that I attended in person: [Day One](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-one/ "GDC 2015 Day One") - [Day Two](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-two/ "GDC 2015 Day Two") - [Day Three](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-three/ "GDC 2015 Day Three") - [Day Four](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-four/ "GDC 2015 Day Four") - [Day Five](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-five/ "GDC 2015 Day Five")
