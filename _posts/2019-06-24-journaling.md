At the start of 2019, I decided to run an experiment: Write in a journal every day of 2019.

It isn't the first time I've given myself a writing challenge. As much as I like to think of myself as a Software Engineer, I also try to make an effort to be an "Artist"
I love having a creative outlet. Interactive experiences, like games, are some of my favorites to create. Though it isn't the only creative outlet, I enjoy it.

I have a lot of strong opinions and love to rant about them. It just makes sense to start writing some of those opinions down in some form.

I've tried writing challenges before, to some success, but nothing that has been able to make the daily writing habit stick.

I do better when I create rules and structures for myself, so this year, I had a simple rule: "I must write at least one full sentence in a journal every single day."

Now I had a choice: Digital vs. Analog/Physical Book

I decided to start doing both. I figured after a month or two eventually I'll favor one over the other. Well, that didn't happen. So for every day in 2019, I've been doing both. I don't know if I'll settle for sure the question of which is better. I have a strong bias toward digital in general. Analog hasn't captured me enough to want to give on up on the digital medium, but there is enough there that I haven't given up on analog yet. We'll see how I feel once we hit the year mark.

However, on a related note, I am not longer an Evangelist at Microsoft. I'm doing even more cool engineering than ever before, but I'm talking about it publically a lot less. I enjoyed writing a blog, so I figure I ought to take another stab at it.

I could make a commitment to one post a month or something like that, but I'm not sure I'll even hold myself to that. For now, if you enjoy hearing me rant, let me know any suggestions on topics you want me to write about!
