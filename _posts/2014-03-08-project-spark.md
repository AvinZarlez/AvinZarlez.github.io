<a title="Project Spark" href="http://projectspark.com/" target="_blank">Project Spark</a> is a cool new game development tool being developed by Microsoft. It is a game that allows you to make games for Windows 8 and Xbox one.

Imagine the fun of those in-game level editors in Halo or Tony Hawk. It''s like that, but instead of just a new level, you can create a whole new game.Â You can make a game on your console, desktop or tablet, and then play it with your friends on xbox live. There is already a growing community of developers making new assets and tools within the game for people to make awesome games.

Fellow Microsoft Evangelist <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/palermo4/" target="_blank">Michael Palermo</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/palermo4/archive/2014/03/07/devradio-project-spark.aspx" target="_blank">interviewed </a>Henry Sterchi and Mike Lescault from the Project Spark team on his latest episode of <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/DevRadio/" target="_blank">DevRadio</a> and talked with them about it.

If you''d like to learning more about it, I would <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/DevRadio/Microsoft-DevRadio-Developing-for-Windows-8-in-1-2-the-Time-Project-Spark" target="_blank">recommend listening in</a>! I found it interesting.
