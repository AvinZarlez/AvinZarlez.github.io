## Tuesday, GDC 2015 Day Two

Today was the second day of Summits and Tutorials.

I went to a variety of talks. From practical advice for creating AI ("Less is More: Designing Awesome AI"), to failed projects ("Epic Fail Microtalks: Four Mobile Games, Four Flops and Tons of Lessons Learned"), to how to interact with YouTubers ("Everything you need to know about YouTubers but were afraid to ask").

My co worker [Amanda Lange](http://secondtruth.com/)&#8216;s talk "[Beyond Binary Choices: How Players Engage with Morality](http://www.schedule.gdconf.com/session/beyond-binary-choices-how-players-engage-with-morality)" was also a highlight. I recommend you check it out on the GDC Vault if you didn''t get a chance to see it today!

Unity also had a big announcement today, you can read the full details on my [earlier blog post](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/unity-5-announcements/). Most important: Unity 5 will be **free** for indie game developers! If you make less than $100k (or have less than 100k in funding) the new Unity Personal Edition will give you all the major features of Unity 5 for free.

## Tomorrow

Tomorrow morning at 11am is my talk “[Best Practices for Small Studios: Outmaneuver Your Competition](http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/best-practices-for-small-studios-outmaneuver-your-competition)”. I am very excited, as it''s my first time speaking at GDC in SF!

I hope I see you all there tomorrow morning! Remember, you''ll need a Main Conference or an All Access pass to get in.
