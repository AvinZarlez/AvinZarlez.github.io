I have been to ten Game Developer Conferences, or "GDCs"

For ten GDCs, I have been able to meet and socialize with friends and acquaintances alike bonding over our shared passions.

For ten GDCs, I have made new friendships that have changed the course of my life and career.

For ten GDCs, I have learned from the knowledge and experience of others.

For ten GDCs, I have left so inspired and enthusiastic over my craft that can barely contain my excitement.

Tomorrow is my eleventh GDC, and it is special.

Tomorrow, for the first time, <a title="My GDC Next talk" href="http://schedule.gdcnext.com/session/outmaneuvering-your-competition-its-cheaper-than-you-think" target="_blank">I hope to be the one that teaches and inspires</a>.
