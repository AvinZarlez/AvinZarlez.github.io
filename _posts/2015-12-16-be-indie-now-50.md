excerpt: |
  Hey everyone! This episode of Be Indie Now has been a long time coming. I recorded it many months ago, before my daughter was born. However, I did not have time to put the episode together before the big day. Since then I had taken a break and not been able to keep releasing updates at the pace I did before.
  
  Have no fear though, Be Indie Now is back! Starting with this "almost lost" episode where I interview Will Hellwarth from Goodbyeworld Games.
  
  This will be the last episode of 2015. If you are interested in being a guest on the show in 2016, let me know!
