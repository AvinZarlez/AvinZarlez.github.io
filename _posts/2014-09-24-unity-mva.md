Fellow Microsoft Evangelists <a href="http://completedevelopment.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Adam Tuliper</a>, <a href="http://www.indiedevspot.com/" target="_blank">David Crook</a>, <a href="http://davevoyles.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Dave Voyles</a>, and <a href="http://jasongfox.com/" target="_blank">Jason Fox</a>, Indie Game Designer/Artist <a href="https://twitter.com/mnewmanart" target="_blank">Matt Newman</a>, Lead Unity Evangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlUnity" target="_blank">Carl Callewaert</a>, and of course myself got together and recorded this live about two weeks ago.

If you weren''t able to catch it then, it''s now available for everybody to check out!

I appeared on modules 2 and 8. Module 2 is about 2D Game Development using Unity, and Module 8 is about Marketing and Monetizing your game.

If you would like the scripts/assets Carl and I used in module 2, as I <a href="http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/09/sample-unity-assets/" target="_blank">posted earlier</a> the files are up <a href="https://github.com/TobiahM/10th-Planet" target="_blank">on my GitHub page</a>.

When I wasn''t in a module, I was in the chat room answering questions. If you''re interested, you can download the public chat logs on the <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/developing-2d-3d-games-with-unity-for-windows-jump-start" target="_blank">jump start page</a>.

I would highly recommend anybody into Unity game development check this out. Especially some of the more advanced topics like Optimizing Your Games, Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), and Azure Mobile Services (using Prime[31]). Those subjects not often covered in other tutorials, and they contain a lot of useful information for Unity developers for all platforms.

I think we put together a great resource here for learning Unity. I hope you enjoy it!

If you do, please share it! Microsoft Virtual Academy (MVA) also has other great game development trainings, you may want to <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-topics/game-development" target="_blank">check them out as well</a>.
