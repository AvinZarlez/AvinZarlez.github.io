## Be Indie Now 20:

#### Bullet Boy by Pomelo Games

During the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, I met Alvaro, Felipe, Juan Pedro, and Sebastian from Pomelo Games. They are making a game called Bullet Boy. It''s a cool looking puzzle game with a mechanic near and dear to my heart, launching the main character out of a cannon!

I was lucky enough to be able to sit down with the four of them and record an episode with my portable podcasting rig. If the sound quality is not as good as other episodes, I apologize. It is because we were sitting in a hallway in the middle of the Moscone center.

I hope you enjoy hearing the story of their development, what they''ve learned, and their future plans for the game.
