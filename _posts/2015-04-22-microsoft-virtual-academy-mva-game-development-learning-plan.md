## What is Microsoft Virtual Academy (MVA)?

MVA has free trainings on a variety of subjects, from high level overviews to in-depth technical discussions.

I have been part of two MVAs, one on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200634648&#038;CR_EAC=300303029" target="_blank">basics of game production</a> and another on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200634648&#038;CR_EAC=300303030" target="_blank">developing games with Unity</a>.

I thought I''d take a moment and give you 1-2 recommended links based on your game development skill level.
