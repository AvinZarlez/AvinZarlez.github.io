New to me, I should say. These meetups have been going for a little while, I just haven''t attended them before.

On Tuesday, I went to the <a title="Southbay Game Development Group Meetup Page" href="http://www.meetup.com/southbay-game-development-group/" target="_blank">South Bay Game Development Group</a>. I don''t know why I haven''t heard of this event before, it was a lot of fun. They meet monthly at the <a title="7 Stars Bar & Grill" href="http://7starsbar.com/" target="_blank">7 Stars Bar & Grill</a>.

It was a small-ish group of 30 or so people, which gave me a chance to talk with everybody who was there. Some were showing off their games, and others like me were just there to socialize. I always worry about going to meetups in bars, sometimes they can get really loud and it''s hard to talk to people. 7 Stars was a good venue. It never got too loud, and while I didn''t have any myself the food looked pretty good.

I got there early and stayed late, and when I left there were still over a half a dozen people taking turns trying out a game on the Oculus Rift somebody had brought. I will definitely make to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/southbay-game-development-group/events/142600972/" target="_blank">their next meetup on October 29th</a>. If you''re able to get to San Jose I would recommend that you do too!

The other meetup I made it to this week was Tech in Motion''s Mobile Gaming event. <a title="Tech in Motion Silicon Valley" href="http://www.meetup.com/TechinMotionSiliconValley/events/138632122/" target="_blank">Tech in Motion</a> is a group that runs a series of tech related events, from mobile UX design to healthcare. This month''s theme was game development.

This first and last parts of the event were for socializing, including free drink tickets which was rather nice of them. In the middle they had two lectures. One from Nvidia talking about the Shield, and the other from Raindrop Games, a small indie studio that released an (unsuccessful) iOS game. I like listening to post-mortems of projects, both successful and "failures". You can learn a lot from what doesn''t work. I didn''t agree with everything Josh said, but he had learned some valuable lessons the hard way and was able to realize some of his mistakes.

Many of the people I met there were new to game development. It was interesting to talk to people who weren''t experienced with game dev, but eager to learn more about it.

I like going to new meetup groups. It''s nice to see a mix of new and familiar faces. If you''re aware of any other awesome San Francisco Bay Area meetups I should check out, send me an email and let me know!
