Windows 8 App Madness is a challenge for current college students to create apps for Windows 8 and get paid. Create and publish a Windows 8 app by April 14th, 2014 and you could win a $50 gift card. If your app is good and receives over 100 downloads, you''ll then have a chance to win an additional $50 gift card. Just follow these three steps:

### Step one: Make an app

Never made an app before? Not a problem! Microsoft has a bunch of resources and all the tools you need to get started and create awesome apps. Just go to <http://aka.ms/GetStartedNow> for more info.

### Step two: Publish and submit to challenge
