Last year on the Be Indie Now podcast I [interviewed Corey Cole about Hero-U](http://www.OLDURL/2014/04/be-indie-now-24-hero-u-rogue-redemption/).

Now, Corey is [back on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/transolargames/hero-u-adventure-role-playing-game) to finish the game. As of this writing, they''re already over half way there and still have 27 days to go.

Corey was nice enough to sit down and be interviewed again by me, only this time through text rather than audio.

### DEADNAME: First off, what is Hero-U?

> **Corey:** Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption is an RPG / Adventure Game for PC’s (Win/Mac/Linux). It is the spiritual successor to the award-winning Quest for Glory games, and the first of a planned five game series all set in Hero University. It features conversation, exploration, character development, and turn-based tactical combat.

### DEADNAME: Tell me about the team behind Hero-U.

> **Corey:** The project is directed by Lori and Corey Cole, creators of Quest for Glory and Castle of Dr. Brain. Our worldwide team of developers includes talented artists JP Selwood (artist behind many Himalaya Studios games), Eric Varnes, Paul Bowers, and Aaron Martin. Former Sierra artists Terry Robinson and Chris Willis have also contributed to the art. Our programmers include Jonathan Cheatham, Joshua Smyth, Cidney Hamilton, Robert Kety, and Rob Eisenberg. Award-winning composer Ryan Grogan is responsible for the stirring musical soundtrack. 

### DEADNAME: You had a successfully funded Kickstarter for the game back in 2012 and raised $409,150 (Goal was $400,000) – How has development progressed these since then?

> **Corey:** We’ve made tremendous progress. The art is 80% complete. Programming is making good progress since we added three contractors in January 2015. We’ve run into the usual challenges that every game project faces, but currently everything looks strong. 

### DEADNAME: What’s has changed most about the game since the original Kickstarter?

> **Corey:** The biggest change is in the art style. We originally proposed to make a top-down game with simplistic characters, and most of the effort in the story. Due to early team changes, we revised the look to be similar to a classic Sierra or LucasArts adventure game, but with extensive use of 3D environments and characters to make a much larger world than those games could manage. 

### DEADNAME: How has the community around the game evolved?

> **Corey:** Our backers have been amazing. I originally estimated the release date as one year after the Kickstarter. That was crazy to start with, and team changes made it impossible. We’ve now been working on the game for two and one-half years, and it is finally now realistically within that one-year window of completion. All that time, most of our backers have strongly supported us, and many of them are returning to pledge additional funds in the second Kickstarter. 

### DEADNAME: What has been the biggest challenge or problems you’ve faced?

> **Corey:** Team changes, mostly caused by a lack of funding. We’ve had multiple developers leave the team for “offers they couldn’t refuse”. One took a full-time contract, one went to Electronic Arts, another to Google, two to other companies. Three other developers had severe health problems or family issues. Our team members are extremely loyal, but real world issues take precedence. 

### DEADNAME: Why are you running a second Kickstarter, as opposed to other ways to get the remaining needed funds?

> **Corey:** We have no publisher contacts, so that was not an option. I talked to a group of media investors in 2013. They were ready to invest $500,000, but that deal would not have left us enough to start on the second game. Most importantly, we have so much more to show now than we had in 2012, and we wanted to show the new look of the game to our fans on Kickstarter so they can be a part of the project. 

### DEADNAME: How do you plan to promote this second Kickstarter campaign (going on right now)?

> **Corey:** We have reached out to a number of gaming press outlets. There is not as much coverage for Kickstarter campaigns as there was in 2012, so it’s challenging. We’ve promoted the new campaign to our previous backers, many of whom are returning because they believe in us and the project, and can see the progress. We urge anyone who visits our Kickstarter, whether or not they choose to back, to click the Share button on our page so that your friends can see Hero-U. 

### DEADNAME: Thank you for sharing your story. Where can we learn more about Hero-U?

> **Corey:** First, visit <https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/transolargames/hero-u-adventure-role-playing-game> to see the Kickstarter campaign. Watch the short video and share the project. We will be posting regular project updates there.
> 
> Also visit [www.hero-u.com](http://www.hero-u.com). We have shared two playable demos – One showing the adventure game side of Hero-U, and one letting players try out RPG exploration and combat – on [www.hero-u.com/press](http://www.hero-u.com/press). That page also has some examples of the game art.

Thanks again Corey! Good luck with the new campaign.
