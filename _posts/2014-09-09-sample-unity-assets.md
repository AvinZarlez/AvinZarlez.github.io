excerpt: |
  Today was the first day of the Microsoft Virtual Academy: Developing 2d and 3d games with Unity for Windows jump start.
  
  Lead Unity Evangelist Carl Callewaert and myself gave a demo of Unity 2D during module 2. One of the most asked questions was, "where can I get those art assets and scripts?"
  
  Well, I have your answer!
