Last couple of weeks I''ve traveled around helping run various <a title="Day of Unity events coming to a city near you!" href="http://www.OLDURL/2014/04/day-unity-events-coming-city-near/" target="_blank">Day of Unity events</a>. It''s been a lot of fun, and I''ve gotten a chance to meet a lot of <a title="Unity3D" href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity </a>game developers. Some with experience, many trying out Unity for the first time.

One of the best features of Unity is the <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">asset store.</a> From there you can download all sorts of assets and packages that help speed up your development.

Which brings me to a question: What Unity plugin(s) do you use?

I''m curious to know which plugins people believe are "must haves", or were useful for them in their development.

Let me know by leaving a comment, through my [Contact](http://www.OLDURL/contact/ "Contact") page, or in person at Day of Unity Portland or Day of Unity Seattle!
