excerpt: |
  The latest episode of South Park is all about freemium games.
  
  I am a big fan of South Park in general, but this episode had me laughing non-stop. I believe this is now my new favorite episode of South Park.
  
  I would highly recommend you watch it, especially if you are a game developer. Not only is it funny parody, but it's a great commentary on the state of the industry.

  Content Warning: South Park is known for bad language and highly offensive humor, viewer discretion is advised.

The latest episode of South Park is all about freemium games.

I am a big fan of South Park in general, but this episode had me laughing non-stop. I believe this is now my new favorite episode of South Park.

I would highly recommend you watch it, especially if you are a game developer. Not only is it funny parody, but it''s a great commentary on the state of the industry.

###### **Content Warning**: South Park is known for bad language and _**highly**_ offensive humor, viewer discretion is advised.

[Click here to watch on South Park''s website](http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s18e06-freemium-isnt-free).

It''s worth noting that not every freemium game is the neo-gambling style that the show is talking about.

I am most interested in hearing Trey and Matt''s commentary on this episode. Like some other episodes they''ve done in the past, I wouldn''t be surprised if this episode is very referential to some conversations that might be going on behind closed doors in South Park Studios.
