The feature is currently in beta, and past data is still being collected. Right now it has the top 500 apps since December 24, 2013, but more will come over the next few weeks.

I''ve added a link to App Annie on my [resources](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/resources/ "Resources for Game and App Developers") page, another website I had forgotten to add before.

This is a very useful tool for developers to track which apps are popular, for how long, in which countries. I am very interested in seeing some hard data comparing the differences between top apps in the Windows markets.

There has been lots of analysis of apps between iOS and Android, but I haven''t seen as much hard data for the characteristics of successful Windows Apps, and how they may be different from the characteristics of successful iOS/Android apps.
