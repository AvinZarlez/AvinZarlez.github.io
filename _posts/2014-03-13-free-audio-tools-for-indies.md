Both Firelight Technologies and Audiokinetic announced this week that they have released free audio tools for indie game developers.<!--more-->

## FMOD Studio

Now indies can use <a href="http://www.fmod.org/download/" target="_blank">all of their tools</a>, includes their <a href="http://www.fmod.org/browse-unity-integration/" target="_blank">Unity integration plugin</a>, to edit their audio files, create interactive music and sound effect generators.

Before this, people could get FMOD Studio free only for personal non-commercial projects, and <a href="http://www.fmod.org/sales/" target="_blank">price </a>ranged from $500 to $15,000 per title depending on the projects budget/scope.

#### Who gets FMOD Studio free, and who has to pay?

[Gamasutra reports](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/212696/FMOD_Studio_audio_tools_now_completely_free_for_indies.php) that while Firelight "didn''t expand on who exactly it classes as an &#8216;indie developer'" the FMOD studio twitter stated it would be "absolutely free for budgets under 100k."

You can get your free copy by going to their <a href="http://www.fmod.org/download/" target="_blank">download page</a>.

## Wwise

Similar to FMOD Studio, indie can use Wwise to create and manage interactive audio content.

Wwise pricing structure is based on which plugins you use in addition to product budget, you can find all the details <a href="https://www.audiokinetic.com/licensing/pricing/" target="_blank">on their website</a>.

#### Who gets Wwise free, and who has to pay?

<a href="https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise/" target="_blank">Wwise</a>&#8216;s indie pricing is not based on budget, but rather how many assets you use. <a href="https://www.audiokinetic.com/about/news/audiokinetic-announces-indie-focused-limited-commercial-license/" target="_blank">According to their website</a>, indie developers using less than 200 assets will be able to get a commercial license for free.

Audiokinetic did not just want to limit use based solely on budget, as many indies are finding new ways to get funding. "We want them all to have the opportunity to use the best tools available to them, and for audio, that means Wwise,‚Äù said Martin H. Klein, President and CEO.

You can download Wwise from <a href="https://www.audiokinetic.com/downloads/" target="_blank">their website</a>.

## What will you do with these free audio tools?

These high-end interactive audio tools were reserved for games with large budgets (and thus large scopes), but now with them being more accessible to indies I hope to see a lot more interesting things happen with audio design in upcoming indie titles.

It''ll be interesting to see which of the two becomes more popular, Wwise or FMOD Studio. Will one win other the other in features/ease of use? Will their difference in pricing factor in? We''ll have to see.
