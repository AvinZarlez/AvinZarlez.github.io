I''ve released a new game!

Well, some might debate if it is a "game". Let me put it this way, if you''re the kind of person that thinks certain games "aren''t _really_ games", then this is **not** a game.

Instead, I like the label "interactive short story"<!--more-->

## About “They’re Staring At You”

“<a title="They're staring at you" href="http://www.playperro.com/games/staring/" target="_blank">They’re Staring At You</a>” is an interactive short story about self-expression and feeling judged.

The game was created using <a title="Twine" href="http://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine, </a>and initially prototyped in a weekend shortly GDC 2014. It then sat on my hard drive untouched, until just after GDC 2015 when I decided to finish it.

Now, I''m releasing it publicly for everybody to play!

## What is an "interactive short story"?

Have you ever read a chose your own adventure game? Well, imagine a similar concept, only digital. Not just a choice of what passage to read next, but also introduce JavaScript logic with variables, conditional statements, etc.

That''s pretty much the magic of <a title="Twine" href="http://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a>.

If you want to learn more you can read this <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LizEngland/20150313/238709/What_is_Twine_For_Developers.php" target="_blank">great summary of Twine</a> by Liz England on Gamasutra, or <a class="urlextern" title="http://www.auntiepixelante.com/twine/" href="http://www.auntiepixelante.com/twine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anna Anthropy''s How To Make Games With Twine</a>.

## Where can I play?

## Ok, I''ll try it!

Great! I am really interested in hearing your feedback about the game.

If you do play it, I would be super grateful if you answered the following questions for me:

  * Who did you feel you were playing as?
  * Favorite moments?
  * Were there any parts you didn''t enjoy?
  * Would you like to see a mobile/app version of this?
  * Are you interested in reading more interactive short stories like this?

I''ve always wanted to spend some time doing more fiction writing, and doing interactive short stories seems like a great way to merge that with my passion for creating games.

No matter the answers (or if you bother to give feedback at all), I really appreciate anybody taking the time to read my writing.

Hope you enjoy it!
