Last week my co-worker <a title="Doris Chen Blog" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dorischen/" target="_blank">Doris Chen</a> and I went to San Jose State University and talked to students about game development.

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2231" alt="SJSU Game Workshop" src="/assets/2013/11/SJSUNov-Workshop-1024x576.jpg?resize=604%2C339" width="604" height="339" srcset="/assets/2013/11/SJSUNov-Workshop.jpg?resize=1024%2C576 1024w, /assets/2013/11/SJSUNov-Workshop.jpg?resize=300%2C169 300w, /assets/2013/11/SJSUNov-Workshop.jpg?w=1320 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/assets/2013/11/SJSUNov-Workshop.jpg)At the workshop we gave students instructions on how to sign up for [DreamSpark](https://www.dreamspark.com/ "DreamSpark") to get free tools and [Windows store developer accounts](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps? "Windows Store Developer Accounts"), as well an overview of what they need to know to start their own independent game development.

Then we showed them how to make a basic game in [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2 "Construct 2"), websites where they can go to find <a title="OpenGameArt.org" href="http://opengameart.org/" target="_blank">game assets</a>, <a title="The Noun Project" href="http://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">symbols</a>, and <a title="FreeSound.org" href="http://www.freesound.org/" target="_blank">sounds</a>, as well as other [resources](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/resources/ "Resources").

After the workshop, we issued them a challenge to make their own games, and then next week come back and present what they made. We also invited other student game developers to join in the challenge if they wanted.

Last night, we had 14 games demoed for us! Every one was impressive. Some had never worked on a game before! There were shooters, platformers, puzzlers, some action/runner games, and even an RTS.

It was great to see student’s excitement on making their own projects!

The winning game was "Gravity Drift", a puzzle game where you used planets gravity to move an alien floating in space.

There was also an "Audience Favorite" prize, and a game called "Snake Battle" won. It was a new take on the classic "snake"/Tron type game in Unity, with power ups and up to 4 player multiplayer.<figure id="attachment_2271" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

I encouraged all the students to continue developing their games. Right now is one of the best times to start your own company, especially if you’re a student. The risk is at an all-time low, and the potential reward an all time high.

I can''t wait to see them all released in the store!
