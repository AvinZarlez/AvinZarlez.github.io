[Indie Game Developers of Silicon Valley](http://www.meetup.com/Indie-Game-Developers-of-Silicon-Valley/) Meetup group presents: A <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Indie-Game-Developers-of-Silicon-Valley/" target="_blank">free screening</a> of "**Thank You For Playing**" with filmmaker Q&A afterwards.

### **What is "Thank You for Playing"?**

"Thank You for Playing" is a documentary of the indie game "That Dragon, Cancer"

The game is an autobiographical story of about Joel Green. Joel is the son of indie game developers Ryan and Amy Green. Together they created a unique game about their emotional journey raising Joel as he was diagnosed with brain cancer.<!--more-->

The film documents Ryan and Amy as they decide what they wanted to share with the world, and where they wanted to draw the line. From reenacting difficult conversations, to recording Joel’s giggle, to painstakingly photographing every detail of the hospital, their lives become consumed by the complicated process of creating a digital world that mirrors their own. All the while still continuing to love and care for their dying child.

### **What if I haven''t played the game?**

That is OK! We will have the game on a laptop or two. You do not need to have played the game first in order to enjoy or understand the film.

### **What is the schedule?**

We will be at the <a href="http://microsoftreactor.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Reactor</a> on 680 Folsom in San Francisco starting at 6pm on May 9th 2016. We will start the actual film by 6:30pm at the latest, so don''t be late!

Afterwards, we will join the filmmakers via Skype for a Q&A session.

### How do I sign up/join in

### **Can I bring a friend?**

Yes! Bring anyone interested in watching the documentary, even if they aren''t normally into video games. It is an extremely emotional and touching story for everyone, not just fellow indie game developers.

### **Will there be food?**

I would love it if I could get sponsor(s) for this event!
