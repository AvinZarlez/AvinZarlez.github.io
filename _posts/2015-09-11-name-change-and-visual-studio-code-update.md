Hello everybody!

I''m back to Evangelism after taking a break from work for a couple of months due to the [birth of my child](http://www.tobiahz.com/2015/06/zafira-zarlez-nofilter-2/).

If you are annoyed by posts of baby pictures: I am sorry. I will try to keep it to a minimum!

First thing I want to note is, my URL has changed! Which, if you''re reading this, you might have already noticed&#8230;

I am no longer Tobiah Marks. My name is now Tobiah Zarlez!

As such:

  * This website is now [TobiahZ.com](http://www.TobiahZ.com/)!
  * My twitter is now <a href="https://twitter.com/tobiahzarlez" target="_blank">@TobiahZarlez</a>
  * Many of my other accounts have changed, check out the social bar located on the left (or top) of the page.

Please update your bookmarks accordingly. Also, let me know if you find any stray links or 404''s. In theory though, everything should forward nicely!

Secondly, I want to let you all know that I have updated my [Visual Studio Code Ultimate Guide](http://www.tobiahz.com/2015/05/visual-studio-code/) with some new information. The integration with Unity is now even better!

If you''re interesting in checking out (or taking a second look) at Visual Studio Code, take a look: <http://www.tobiahz.com/2015/05/visual-studio-code/>
