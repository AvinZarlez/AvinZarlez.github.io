When making the executable for your app, pay close attention to your file size.

When you compile your code, images, sound, videos&nbsp;and other assets all together, your apps can easily become quite large. I''ve seen too many games that sit in the 250mb to 2gb range. Sometimes the game wasn''t that large at release, but they [added content over time](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2013/10/apps-service-product/ "Apps are a service, not a product") and the file size grew in equal proportion. Some games need that much, but many could be done very similarly with a smaller size, if they just put a little extra effort into it.

### What should my file size be?

For mobile platforms, I would highly recommend you to make your best effort to fit your app under the cellular download limit. Depending on the persons carrier, plan, and which store they''re downloading from, that could be anywhere from **20mb to 50mb**. That may not sound like much, but I assure you, there are many complex apps with long-lasting meaningful content under 50mb.

Unless your app is asset heavy and hours long, users&nbsp;aren''t very tolerant of large file size. Yes, there are some kinds of games can get away with larger file sizes. If you''re a premium game&nbsp;(especially if you cost more than $3) and/or&nbsp;target core gamers with realistic 3d graphics,&nbsp;generally users will be more forgiving&nbsp;of larger&nbsp;file sizes.&nbsp;**_Only&nbsp;if it''s warranted_**.

### Downloads

No matter what, if you have a large file size&nbsp;you''re imposing requirements the user may not be willing or able to overcome. Users will judge&nbsp;the value of your app, and only download if it''s&nbsp;greater than the additional "cost to entry"&nbsp;requirement.&nbsp;First, they have to get access to WiFi. Second, they must have enough room on their device. The second could be harder to get than the first, depending on exactly how big your app is.

For whatever reason, let''s say they cannot download your app at the moment. If they liked your&nbsp;app enough to want it in the first place,&nbsp;that extra "cost" pushed them over the edge to decide to not buy it, losing a customer. Even if they decide to "get it later", they''ll&nbsp;resume going&nbsp;about their day, and by the nature of people naturally&nbsp;they''re likely to forget about you. Never making the&nbsp;time to go back to the store later and download.&nbsp;Again,&nbsp;you''ve created a friction point and lost potential&nbsp;customers.

Or worse, and most likely, they won''t look at the file size requirement before purchasing.&nbsp;When they realize they aren''t able to use the app they just tried to download (possibly paid money for!), they might decide to rate you poorly on the store in frustration. Even if they haven''t actually used the app yet.

### Uninstalls<figure id="attachment_1051" style="width: 180px" class="wp-caption alignright">

It''s one thing to talk about file size in terms of being harmful to the struggle to get a user to download your app, but it''s&nbsp;equally&nbsp;important for preventing&nbsp;uninstalls afterwards.

When I run out of space on my phone, first thing I do is look at my apps sorted by size. If you''re app floats to the top of that list, you''re that much more likely to get uninstalled. Even if the user overall likes your app, if they need the space that may not enjoy your app enough over being able to fit more mp3 files or other new apps on their device. If you''re one of the smaller file sizes, at the 3g download level or under, the user has to scroll way down their list usually to reach your app.

Your competition, other apps that are larger than you, become much more appealing targets to uninstall first, even if they use them more often than yours. If you''re app is 25mb and theirs is 100mb, I would rather have one app I kinda like + 1-3 other apps or files I may enjoy than one 100mb app I use semi often.

### Value of keeping users

Even if you''re a premium app with no in app purchases or ad revenue, active installs matter. Users who don''t keep your app on their phone&nbsp;will harm your business.&nbsp;With every uninstall, you''re&nbsp;losing potential:

  * Marketing. Users often find new apps by&nbsp;observing which ones&nbsp;their friends/strangers use or have installed on their devices.
  * Recommendations. Users are more likely to recommend an app to a friend if they use it/keep it on their phone constantly.
  * Ranking. Active installs probably plays a key&nbsp;factor in app store rankings. Also, long time users are more likely to positively review the app, which will also help your rank.
  * Future Revenue. What if you add IAP some day? If they no longer use your app, no longer a potential customer of new content.
  * Future Apps Success. It''s a lot easier to advertise a new app to an existing user base of an older app.

Just to name a few.

The difference between 48mb and 75mbs can easily be thousands of installs (or uninstalls prevented).

Take a second look at your app before shipping it. Can you reduce the file size? It could be worth the extra time and effort to decrease the size as much as possible before you ship.
