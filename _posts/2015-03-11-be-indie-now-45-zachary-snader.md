  Be Indie Now 45: Zachary Snader
  
  This week we bring in somebody from the indie publishing business. With the growing industry, there is a lot more room for smaller publishers to help out indie developers with parts of the business they aren’t as equipped to handle. Zachary shares the story of his company and what his goals are.
