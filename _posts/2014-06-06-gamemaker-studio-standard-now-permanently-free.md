Those who follow my blog will know that GameMaker Studio <a href="http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/02/gamemaker-studio-standard-free/" target="_blank">would go</a> <a href="http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2013/11/gamemaker-studio-standard-free-limited-time/" target="_blank">on sale</a>, <a href="http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/05/gamemaker-studio-sale-may-25th/" target="_blank">a lot</a>. It''s great that they finally just removed the limited resource free version and made the Standard version available to every developer.

If you are just starting out, or a student learning how to make games, I would highly recommend downloading it. GameMaker can teach you how to code, how to create games, and now let you make anything you want.

They have not reduced the price of GameMaker Studio Pro. That remains $100. Still, never a bad thing to get more features in the free version.

If you haven''t yet, go ahead and <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/studio/download" target="_blank">download it for yourself</a>!
