After the [last](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/06/think-multiplatform/) [two](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/06/multiplatform-game-frameworks/) "Ask Tobiah" questions were about multiplatform development, time to change things up a bit:

As an Evangelist from Microsoft, I don’t have access to numbers or percentages. Even if I did, I would not be able to share them due to privacy agreements unless given explicit permission to do so. But, I can speak from my own personal experience.<!--more-->

Based purely on my conversations with developers and my experience, the Windows Phone market is more like iPhone than Android in terms of successful monetization structures.

Free obviously gets downloaded way more than paid apps, and unlike Android a good percentage of users are able and willing to spend money on in app purchases. Especially since the market is smaller and there are less good games out there, when a quality app comes along users are willing to spend money on it.

That said, even though Freemium apps generally makes the most money, that doesn’t mean paid apps won’t do well. It depends entirely on the app, quality, store presence, etc. just like in other app stores.

One thing that does make us different is our “Trial” mode, which allows users to download paid apps for free. It’s an optional feature set up by the developer. It can either be time limited, or some other limit enforced through code. For instance, you can make only the first level of your game free and/or block certain features. If it makes sense for the design of the app, I have heard that this will often increase the number of purchases. Users are more willing to pay for an app if they know what they’re going to get.

This is similar to making a free app with a single in app purchase to unlock the rest, only with the app is listed as paid in the store, just with free trial. The difference is subtle, and mostly based on what kind of app you have and what you want for your app store presence. You are not required to use one method or the other, it’s just another option available to you.

If you do end up going Freemium, [make sure you do it right](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/03/free-to-play-game-design/). For further monetization and marketing tips, you should read [this blog post](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/03/marketing-monetization-strategies/) I wrote a few months ago.

I hope that answers your question! If you have something you would like to ask me for a future blog post, please [email me](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/contact/ "Contact")!
