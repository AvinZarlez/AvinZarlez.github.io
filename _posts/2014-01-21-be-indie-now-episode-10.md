I love storytelling in games. A lot of my favorite games have a strong, well written story to them, or use ways unique to the medium to convey the story.

My guest this week, Laura Michet, is a writer who makes stories that ride the line between novel and games called "Interactive Fiction"

Most of her games are text-based, where the reader clicks various text/links to interact with the story they are reading and move onto the next part. If you have not, I would highly recommend <a title="Laura's Projects" href="http://blog.lauramichet.com/projects/" target="_blank">trying out</a> <a title="Swan Hill" href="http://lauramichet.com/swanhill.html" target="_blank">one of her games first</a> and then listen to the show, so you know what kind of games we''re talking about.

I like to show off a different kind of indie game development that what people normally think of. I think interactive fiction will become more and more popular in the future, at least, I hope it will.

I know I felt inspired to finish my own long neglected visual novel project after talking with Laura, if you''re interested in writing I encourage you all to try your hand at interactive fiction as well!

As always, special thanks to Microsoft for making the show possible.
