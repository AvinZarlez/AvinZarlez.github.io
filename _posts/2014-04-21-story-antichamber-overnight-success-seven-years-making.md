As I said during my [summary of GDC this year](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/03/gdc-2014-final/), this was one of my favorite GDC talks of all time.<!--more-->Alexander goes through his entire process. From starting off as a student developer with nothing, to making millions in revenue. He doesn''t just talk about what technical tools he used, or game design decisions he made, but goes over all the other things an indie developer needs to stand out that sadly are not often talked about.

I love the way he breaks down how to do real networking, not just exchanging business cards. He built friendships that were meaningful, from a personal and professional level. He thought in-depth about how he presented himself, perfected his pitch, and built the skills and contacts he needed to market his game after he finished.

This is the true indie story. Overnight success takes many years of hard work. A must watch for every developer, indie or otherwise.

You can watch and judge for yourself by <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020776/Antichamber-An-Overnight-Success-Seven" target="_blank">clicking this link to go to the GDC Vault</a>.
