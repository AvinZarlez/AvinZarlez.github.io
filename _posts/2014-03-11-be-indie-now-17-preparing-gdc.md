Rachael Reisdorf is a friend of mine and an expert at conferences, both as an attendee and as an exhibitor. She has ran multiple booths at conferences like Siggraph, PAX, and of course the Game Developers Conference happening in San Francisco next week.

I sat down with Rachael and we talked about our philosophy and strategy when preparing for an event like GDC.

What should you do there? Which parties should you attend? How do you deal with all those business cards you''ll collect? We gave our answers based on our experience attending GDC together since 2005.

See you in San Francisco next week!

Special thanks to Microsoft for making the show possible.
