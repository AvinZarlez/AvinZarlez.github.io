I updated my resources page with some new links, and I thought I''d take a moment and point it out if you haven''t seen it before.

You can get to it by clicking the on the top bar of the page, or by [clicking here](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/resources/ "Resources for Game and App Developers").

My goal is to make it a nice go-to list of basic links for indie game developers. I have tools, places to get assets, and some guides/sample code.

It''s by no means a comprehensive list. If you know a link you think might be good to include, please [let me know](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/contact/ "Contact")!
