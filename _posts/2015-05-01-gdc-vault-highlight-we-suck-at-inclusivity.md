vPart four in my series of highlighting free talks from Game Developers Conference 2015!

### What is the GDC Vault?

The [GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/) is a collection of (most of the) talks at various GDC events. Talks from GDC 2015 are now online and you can watch them when you want! If you have an all access, speaker or media badge you get access to the vault. Otherwise, there is an extra charge. However, each year they release certain [talks for free](http://www.gdcvault.com/free/gdc-15). I wanted to highlight some of my favorite talks from this year that are available for everybody to watch for free.

### We Suck at Inclusivity: How Language Creates the Largest Invisible Minority for Games

Rami Ismail of Vlambeer needs no introduction, but for this talk it''s best to describe him as a world traveler. Rami gave two talks this year. One as part of the [GDC Microtalks](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-gdc-microtalks-2015/), and another "<a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022362/We-Suck-at-Inclusivity-How" target="_blank">We Suck at Inclusivity: How Language Creates the Largest Invisible Minority for Games</a>"

Many developers do not think about Arabic at all, and in fact the majority of games don''t even bother translating. When they do, often the results are comical at best for anyone who actually speaks the language. In an effort to promote more understanding, Rami decided to give GDC attendees a basic overview of Arabic. Why is this so important? Well, if you haven''t checked out Rami''s Microtalk, you should [watch that first](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-gdc-microtalks-2015/) and let him explain it himself.

### What other talks would you recommend?

Previously I''ve recommended Stone''s talk on "[game < design](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-game-design/)", "[Keep Grooving: Life Musings & Live Musics](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-keep-grooving-life-musings-live-musics/)" by Teddy Diefenbach and Rich Vreelandwhich, and the [GDC Microtalks](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/gdc-vault-highlight-gdc-microtalks-2015/). All are available for free. My own talk, "[Best Practices for Small Studios](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021832/Best-Practices-for-Small-Studios)", is sadly not available for free. You''ll need access to the full GDC Vault. You can also read my daily GDC summaries for talks that I attended in person: [Day One](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-one/ "GDC 2015 Day One") - [Day Two](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-two/ "GDC 2015 Day Two") - [Day Three](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-three/ "GDC 2015 Day Three") - [Day Four](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-four/ "GDC 2015 Day Four") - [Day Five](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-five/ "GDC 2015 Day Five") Do you have any other talks you thought were highlights of GDC 2015?
