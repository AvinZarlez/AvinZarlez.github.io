Hey everybody!

I just updated the [Resources](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/resources/) page on the site, adding a few more links to some tools and tutorials.

If you have a moment, why don''t you [check it out for yourself](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/resources/)!

### <!--more-->What resources did you add?

Here is some of the links I recently added:

**Coding:**

### What about <Blank>!?

I''m always looking to add more content to the page and make it more useful for developers. If you ever come across an awesome tool, tutorial or other resources please [send it along to me](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/contact/ "Contact") so I can possibly add it to the list!

Enjoy!
