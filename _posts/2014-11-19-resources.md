Hey everybody!

I just updated the [Resources](http://www.OLDURL/resources/) page on the site, adding a few more links to some tools and tutorials.

If you have a moment, why don''t you [check it out for yourself](http://www.OLDURL/resources/)!

### <!--more-->What resources did you add?

Here is some of the links I recently added:

**Coding:**

  * [Visual Studio Community (Free)](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs)
  * <a href="http://www.Unityvs.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Tools for Unity</a>

**Image Tools:**

  * <a href="http://editor.method.ac/" target="_blank">Method Draw</a>
  * <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a>
  * <a href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/" target="_blank">PNGCrush</a>

**Programming/Logic:**

**Shows:**

  * [Be Indie Now](http://www.beindienow.com)
  * [Extra Credits](http://www.extra-credits.net/)

### What about <Blank>!?

I''m always looking to add more content to the page and make it more useful for developers. If you ever come across an awesome tool, tutorial or other resources please [send it along to me](http://www.OLDURL/contact/ "Contact") so I can possibly add it to the list!

Enjoy!
