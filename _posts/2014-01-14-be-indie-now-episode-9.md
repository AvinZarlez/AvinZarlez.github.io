Despite the fact he had an unexpected power outage in his apartment right before the show, I was able to speak with [Felix Rieseberg](http://www.felixrieseberg.com/). Felix makes [Awesome Zombie Sniper](http://www.snipezombies.com/), a first person shooter for Windows 8.

A.Z.S. is Felix''s first game, created using Unity. It''s gotten quite popular, with hundreds of thousands of downloads, and some decent ad revenue. Felix shared with us his philosophy of hobby indie game development, insight to his development process, and what lessons/steps he recommends to other game devs.

If you have Windows 8, I would recommend checking the game out. It''s free!

As always, special thanks to Microsoft for making the show possible.
