## Be Indie Now 35:

#### Michael Todd

Have you ever questioned if you should pursue a career juggling, or indie game development? Michael Todd has.

He chose the latter, and I think he made the better choice.

He formed his own company, hired employees, went deep into debt, and eventually made it all back with his hit indie game [Electronic Super Joy](http://www.electronicsuperjoy.com/). He now works for the <a title="Yazar Media Group" href="http://www.yazarmediagroup.com/" target="_blank">Yazar Media Group</a>, and is busy designing a new procedurally generated game.
