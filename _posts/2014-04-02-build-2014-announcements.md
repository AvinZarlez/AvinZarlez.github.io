Today in San Francisco for Build 2014 Microsoft announced Windows Phone 8.1 and the Windows 8.1 update.

I am super excited for these new features! My personal highlights:<!--more-->

#### Universal Apps

You can now build an app that runs on Windows desktop, tablets, and phones. Even better, Microsoft demoed a universal app running on an Xbox One!

#### Cortana

Voice enabled personal assistant. Schedule tasks, set alarms, etc. Everything you''d expect, plus a few extras. Example; Telling Cortana to remind you about something next time you''re talking to a certain person.

#### Keyboard+Mouse improvements

Minimize apps, show them in a window, right-click menu for live tiles, and as requested the return of the start menu. Almost all the common complaints I''ve heard about Windows 8 on non-touch devices have been addressed and improved.

Can''t wait to get my hands on it and make some universal apps!
