excerpt: |
  Yesterday was the first day of Apple's World Wide Developer Conference 2015, or "WWDC15".
  
  They announced a few new products, but mostly it was app and OS updates.
  
  I thought since so many people enjoyed my <a href="http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/04/build-2015-announcements/">twitter summary of Build announcements</a>, I would make a similar collection of tweets for WWDC15.

One thing that didn''t get highlighted in a tweet: You no longer need to be a paid Apple developer to test on iOS.

Not a huge deal, but it was odd that Apple required you to pay just to develop/test when both Google and Microsoft do not.
