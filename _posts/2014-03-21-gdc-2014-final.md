GDC 2014 is officially over!

This was a fun year for me. I got an Indie Games Summit pass for the first time (as opposed to the All Access pass I had been getting), which meant I had a lot more time to explore GDC beyond the lectures.<!--more-->

### What I did on the last day

Today was the last day of me working the Microsoft booth and the quick start challenges. This was attendees last chance to win the raffle prizes.

Before the final raffle though, I got one last opportunity to wonder the show floor. Fridays are always not the best days for the expo from a combination of exhibitors lack of sleep with a flood of new attendees from the Friday only passes. It''s a good day to grab new t shirts though, if that is the sort of thing you''re after. I try not to get any, I have a large enough supply as is.

Now that it''s over, I will be spending some time with old friends and getting a nice dinner in the city.

### GDC 2014 Highlights

Here are some of my favorite moments of GDC 2014.

#### Antichamber lecture by Alexender Bruce.

Antichamber is an amazing game by Alexender Bruce, and it has made millions. On the second day of the Indie Games Summit, Alexender gave a passionate speech about his story and all the blood sweat and tears that went into its long development. An "overnight success" story that took 8 years.

When the talk is available on the GDC Vault, it will be a must watch. In the mean time, you should <a title="Antichamber" href="http://www.antichamber-game.com/" target="_blank">play the game</a> for yourself and <a title="Antichamber highlights" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/213438/The_biggest_takeaways_from_8_years_of_Antichamber_development.php" target="_blank">read the highlights</a>.

#### Meeting with indies

I love talking to indies. Ok, I''ll be honest, I love talking in general, but honestly I _especially_ love talking to fellow indie game developers. I got a chance to meet so many new people and make new friends this GDC. I was even able to record a podcast with one team. I wish I had more opportunities to sit down longer and get to know those I talked with. Indies are the best people to hang out with.

#### The Inspiration

I say it every year, but it''s worth saying again. I get so inspired by GDC. It fills me with creative energy.

I can''t wait for this weekend when I get to relax and start making some games again. I even started mid-conference working on some old prototypes I had abandoned after listening to a great soapbox rant from Ethan Levy. He wrote <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EthanLevy/20140320/213611/Escaping_the_Indie_Shame_Spiral.php" target="_blank">a blog post about his rant here</a> if you''re interested.
