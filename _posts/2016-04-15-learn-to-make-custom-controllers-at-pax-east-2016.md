I''ll be traveling to Boston next week for PAX East 2016, where fellow Microsoft Evangelists <a href="http://adinashanholtz.com/" target="_blank">Adina Shanholtz</a>, <a href="http://theothergavin.net/" target="_blank">Gavin Bauman</a> and myself will present "<a href="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule/panel/crafting-your-own-controllers-for-immersive-game-experiences" target="_blank">Crafting Your Own Controllers for Immersive Game Experiences</a>"<!--more-->

### PAX East 2016

I am a regular to <a href="http://prime.paxsite.com/" target="_blank">PAX Prime</a> (now called PAX West), but this will be my first time going to <a href="http://east.paxsite.com/" target="_blank">PAX East</a>! Last time I was in Boston was for <a href="https://unity3d.com/unite/boston/keynote" target="_blank">Unite 2015</a>, I but I imagine PAX will be quite a bit bigger.

I really appreciated how similar, but different <a href="http://south.paxsite.com/" target="_blank">PAX South</a> was compared to Prime/West. After this, now I''ll just need an excuse to travel to <a href="http://aus.paxsite.com/" target="_blank">PAX Australia</a> to say I''ve been to them all.

### What will this talk be about?

We will host a panel discussion on creating custom controller experiences. We''ll briefly go over some of the custom controls of the past and present, as well as a technical demo of how you can build your own.

<a href="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule/panel/crafting-your-own-controllers-for-immersive-game-experiences" rel="attachment wp-att-162451"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-162451" src="/assets/2016/04/PAXEast2016Sch.png?resize=640%2C350" alt="PAX East 2016 Schedule" width="640" height="350" srcset="/assets/2016/04/PAXEast2016Sch.png?w=640 640w, /assets/2016/04/PAXEast2016Sch.png?resize=300%2C164 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

You should come with questions! Are you an indie trying to build the perfect controller for your game? Are you a fan, wondering where you can go to play these unique and weird games? Have you already made a custom controller, but not sure what to do next?

Join us <a href="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule/panel/crafting-your-own-controllers-for-immersive-game-experiences" target="_blank">Saturday morning at 10:30am</a> at the CUTTLEFISH THEATRE and let''s talk about it!
