Hey, just because I''m a "developer" doesn''t mean I am terrible at creating art!

&#8230;

I just happen, by pure coincidence, to be both a developer _and_ terrible at art.

You have a couple easy options:

  1. Learn to make the assets yourself.
  2. Get pre-made assets.
  3. Find somebody to make them for you.

### Making it yourself

There are lots of ways to get art assets for your game, without having to learn to create it yourself. Although, I will say, I recommend every developer out there try their hand at Photoshop and know their way around a 3d modeling suite.

Understanding the tools will go a long way in helping make you a better developer, and a better designer.

You should know the different file formats, which tools do what, and how long (or short) the process can take. Just because you can''t do something (due to not having years of practice) doesn''t mean you can''t know how it would be done, and what to expect out of any other artists you work with.

The best way to learn all this? Try making art for yourself. Seriously, [everything is a skill](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2014/01/everything-is-a-skill/ "Everything is a skill â€“ Start practicing"), just start doodling. You may be surprised at the results!

But&#8230; this option does take the most time and effort, so it''s not really practical. I took a lot of art courses in college, but I haven''t done anything beyond some simple Photoshop tweaking in any of my games. Let''s move on to option 2.

### Premade art

There are hundreds of already made, ready to go assets out there waiting for you to use them.

From the <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity asset store</a>, to pay-per-asset websites like <a href="http://www.turbosquid.com/" target="_blank">TurboSquid</a>, to Creative Commons licensed work at <a href="http://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">The Noun Project</a> or <a href="http://opengameart.org/" target="_blank">OpenGameArt.org</a>, there are definitely workable assets there that will help get your game off the ground and starting to look half way decent.

I have purchased multiple assets for various games I have made. I have also used assets from The Noun Project in most of the apps I''ve made.

Once you have your first assets, you can slowly replace them out over time with better, custom-made ones from an artist if you so choose.

### Finding an Artist

How do you get an artist to work for you?

Well, generally, it means you have to pay them in some form.

Maybe you can find an artist to team up with, and they''re invested in the game with you and become business partners. There are tons of college students who know how to make beautiful pieces of art, but have no idea how to code. A lot would love it if a programmer and/or design came along and created something with them.

But, that doesn''t work for everyone. You don''t need to offer a large percentage stake of your game to the first artist who works on a couple of assets. Also, many artists won''t take work unless there is some guaranteed money involved. Nor should they, considering how risky starting a game company is.

It likely would be better for you to be very clear on ownership of the IP, and simply pay an artist for their time to work on your game. It is probably cheaper than you think! Using a site like <a href="https://www.odesk.com/" target="_blank">oDesk </a>or <a href="https://www.elance.com/" target="_blank">eLance</a>, you can find dozens if not hundreds of qualified artists with great portfolios to work within your budget.

My business partner did a lot of the art for our games, and eventually we started regularly hiring contract artists to create new assets as we needed them.

Hopefully one of those three options works for you!
