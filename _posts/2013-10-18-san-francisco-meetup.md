I went to three meetups in San Francisco this week.

First, I stopped by briefly to the <a title="BASE" href="http://www.meetup.com/software/" target="_blank">Bay Area Software Engineers</a> "<a title="The Promise of 3D Printing" href="http://www.meetup.com/software/events/135929602/" target="_blank">The Promise of 3D Printing</a>" event. It was really cool to learn a bit more about 3d printing as a technology. 400 people attended!

I wish I could have been there for the whole time, but I had to duck out early to make it to the <a title="San Francisco Game Development Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/sfgamedevelopers/" target="_blank">San Francisco Game Development Meetup</a>&#8216;s <a title="Monthly Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/sfgamedevelopers/events/137668742/" target="_blank">monthly gathering</a>. This is always a popular meetup, over a hundred game developers met in the Marriott bar to hang out, talk, and show off each others games.

I had some great conversations with fellow independent game developers (and a few freelancers) while I was there. I don''t always go to this meetup, but I went last month as well, and I enjoyed myself. It''s nice to see such a large group of developers interacting with each other. Although due to the nature of the bar, it''s sometimes hard to get around the room to meet many people.

Also this week was <a title="Corona Labs" href="http://www.coronalabs.com/" target="_blank">Corona SDK</a> <a title="Corona SDK Meetup Group" href="http://www.meetup.com/Corona-SDK-Group/" target="_blank">Meetup Group''s</a> <a title="Monetizing Cross-Platform Apps" href="http://www.meetup.com/Corona-SDK-Group/events/141820072/" target="_blank">Monetizing Cross-Platform Apps</a> panel, hosted at <a title="YetiZen" href="http://yetizen.com/" target="_blank">YetiZen</a>. Surprisingly I haven''t visited YetiZen before. They host many events there, but I just haven''t been able to make one until now. It''s a nice space, I appreciated all the art on the walls and the pile of board games in the middle.

Corona ran the meetup, but it wasn''t Corona specific. It was more about monetization of apps in general. The panel had representatives from <a title="Inneractive" href="http://inner-active.com/" target="_blank">Inneractive</a>, <a title="SponsorPay" href="http://sponsorpay.com/" target="_blank">SponsorPay</a>, <a title="Vungle" href="http://vungle.com/" target="_blank">Vungle</a>, and <a title="PlayHaven" href="http://www.playhaven.com/" target="_blank">PlayHaven</a>. It was nice to see so many competitors sitting together talking about monetization in general, and not trying to pitch themselves as why they are better than one another. They also each have slightly different offerings, and even brought up the fact that many profitable games use services from multiple companies, and they work nicely together.

Those are the San Francisco Meetups I went to this week. If you''d like to meet up with me at a future gathering (or even just one on one), please [send me a message](http://tobiahmarks.com/contact/ "Contact") and we can work out the details!
