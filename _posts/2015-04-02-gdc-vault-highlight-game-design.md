Talks from the Game Developers Conference 2015 are now uploaded to the GDC Vault!

### What is the GDC Vault?

The [GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/) is a collection of (most of the) talks at various GDC events. Talks from last month''s GDC 2015 are now online and you can watch them when you want!

If you have an all access, speaker or media badge you get access to the vault. Otherwise, there is an extra charge. However, each year they release certain [talks for free](http://www.gdcvault.com/free/gdc-15).

I wanted to highlight some of my favorite talks from this year that are available for everybody to watch for free.

### "game < design" from Stone Librande

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-101541 size-full" src="/assets/2015/04/gamedesigngdc2015.png?resize=660%2C269" alt="GDC Vault game < design" width="660" height="269" srcset="/assets/2015/04/gamedesigngdc2015.png?w=852 852w, /assets/2015/04/gamedesigngdc2015.png?resize=300%2C122 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022001/game)

I am very lucky to say I was one of Stone''s students in college. I actually took his class twice. Not because I did badly the first time (I got an A), but because I learned so much I wanted to hear all the lectures and do all the homework again. Stone has worked at Blizzard, EA/Maxis, and now Riot Games.

This year his talk was about design. Not "GAME design", but design in general. Even if you don''t consider yourself a designer, I would [recommend checking out this talk](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022001/game). Design ideas apply to everything you create. Whether it''s a software program, a piece of art, or a chair.

### What about your talk?

Sadly, my talk "Best Practices for Small Studios" is not available for free. But, if you have access to the GDC Vault, just search for "Tobiah" and it''ll be the first result.

### What other talks do you recommend?

I''m still going through the vault myself. You can also read my daily GDC summaries for talks that I attended in person: [<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Day One </span></span>](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-one/ "GDC 2015 Day One")- [<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Day Two </span></span>](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-two/ "GDC 2015 Day Two")- [<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Day Three</span></span>](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-three/ "GDC 2015 Day Three") - [<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Day Four </span></span>](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-four/ "GDC 2015 Day Four")- [<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Day Five</span></span>](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/03/gdc-2015-day-five/ "GDC 2015 Day Five")

Do you have any talks you want to highlight from GDC or the GDC Vault? [Let me know](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/contact/ "Contact") about it! I''ll be going through as many of the talks as I can myself slowly but surely over the next couple of months.
