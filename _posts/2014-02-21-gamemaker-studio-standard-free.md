Once again you can get GameMaker Studio Standard <a title="GameMaker Studio Standard Free" href="http://www.yoyogames.com/developers/promotions/sale" target="_blank">free from now until March 2nd</a>, as well as upgrade from Standard to Professional for just $35.

Normally GameMaker Studio Professional is $100, with the free upgrade to Standard that means you can get it for $65 off.

This isn''t the first time <a title="YoYoGames" href="http://www.yoyogames.com/" target="_blank">YoYoGames </a>has offered [GameMaker for free](http://www.OLDURL/2013/11/gamemaker-studio-standard-free-limited-time/ "GameMaker Studio Standard Free for a limited time!") or [discounted the Professional version](http://www.OLDURL/2013/12/upgrade-gamemaker-studio-standard/ "$25 Upgrade GameMaker Studio Standard to Professional"), but you never know when a deal like this will come around again.

#### How to redeem:

  1. Download GameMaker
  2. On the welcome screen, click the “Upgrade to Standard for Free” banner
  3. Enter your email address, and then confirm it on the second screen.
  4. Check your email, and copy/paste your brand new Standard edition key!

If you don''t already have Standard, there is no reason not to jump on this and get yourself a free copy. That way if you ever decide to mess around or [doodle](http://www.OLDURL/2014/01/everything-is-a-skill/ "Everything is a skill – Start practicing") something in GameMaker, you won''t be limited by number of resources.
