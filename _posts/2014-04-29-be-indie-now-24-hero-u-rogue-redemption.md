## Be Indie Now 24:

#### Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption by Transolar Games

Corey Cole has been part of the games industry since the late 80''s working for&nbsp;Sierra. He is most known for developing the Quest for Glory series, along with his wife Lori Cole. Lately, his company Transolar Games has been working on Hero-U, which they successfully raised over $400,000 for on Kickstarter in late 2012.

It was fascinating to hear Corey''s journey into the games industry back in the day, how Hero-U came about, and the development challenges they''ve faced during and after such a large Kickstarter campaign.
