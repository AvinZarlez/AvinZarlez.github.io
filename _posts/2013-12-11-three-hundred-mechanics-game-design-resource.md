  I found a link the other day to an interesting site for game mechanics. It''s called "<a title="Three Hundred Mechanics" href="http://www.squidi.net/three/index.php" target="_blank">Three Hundred Mechanics</a>", created by <a title="Sean Howard Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/sqorgar" target="_blank">Sean Howard</a>.
</p>

The page is a collection of game mechanics/game design ideas. His original goal was to make one mechanic idea a day until he reached 300. He failed his goal, so despite the name at the time of this writing there is only 169 different mechanics.

Still, that''s 169 different game ideas that you can freely use and be inspired by for your next game idea! If you''re stuck in the "I don''t know what to make" rut, click through a few of the entries and see if anything sticks out asÂ particularly interesting to you.

His ideas are public domain and you''re free to use them, just not copy any of his artwork.

Sean''s also make some <a title="Three Hundred Prototypes" href="http://www.squidi.net/threep/index.php" target="_blank">prototypes</a> of some of the ideas to play, and has his own <a title="Free Pixel Project" href="http://www.squidi.net/pixel/index.php" target="_blank">free art resource</a> for you to use in your non-commercial games.

I added the link to <a title="Resources for Game and App Developers" href="http://www.tobiahmarks.com/resources/" target="_blank">my own resources page</a> for future reference.

I hope it''s useful to some of you!
