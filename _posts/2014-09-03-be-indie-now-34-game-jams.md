  Be Indie Now 34: Game Jams
  
  It's the return of the panel style episode! We've been doing a lot of interviews lately, so I thought it would be nice to invite back Davain and Andrew to talk about Game Jams.
  
  There was an article doing around a while ago asking, are game jams worth it? The panel thinks so, and shares their stories of jams gone right and jams gone wrong.
  
  If you're interest, I am also hosting my own game jam in San Francisco on September 12th, 13th and 14th. It's called Alpha Game Jam, you should join us!

## Be Indie Now 34:

#### Game Jams

It''s the return of the panel style episode! We''ve been doing a lot of interviews lately, so I thought it would be nice to invite back Davain and Andrew to talk about Game Jams.

There was an article doing around a while ago asking, are game jams worth it? The panel thinks so, and shares their stories of jams gone right and jams gone wrong.

If you''re interest, I am also [hosting my own game jam](http://www.OLDURL/2014/08/alpha-game-jam/ "Alpha Game Jam September 12th through 14th") in San Francisco on September 12th, 13th and 14th.  It''s called Alpha Game Jam, <a title="Alpha Game Jam" href="http://www.meetup.com/Indie-Game-Developers-of-Silicon-Valley/events/195749962/" target="_blank">you should join us</a>!
