## Be Indie Now 25:

#### Steven Harmon Games

Steven Harmon has been developing games since he was 13 years old. He is 15 now, and has made 16 games! He recently attended one of Microsoft''s Day of Unity events in Denver, Colorado along with his dad, also named Steven Harmon.

I sat down with the both of them and asked Steven (the younger) about his development and his plans for the future, and Steven (the older) about how he supports his son''s development and has enabled him to do so much already.
