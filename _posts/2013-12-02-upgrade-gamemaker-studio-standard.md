This news comes right after they made [GameMaker Studio Standard free for beta users](http://tobiahmarks.com/2013/11/gamemaker-studio-standard-free-limited-time/ "GameMaker Studio Standard Free for a limited time!"), and yes, you can use your free standard license as part of the upgrade.

<a title="Buy GameMaker" href="http://www.yoyogames.com/studio/buy" target="_blank">Normally</a> GameMaker Studio Professional is **$100**, but with this deal you can get it for just **$25**! Even if you already paid the normal $50, that''s just $25 more to upgrade GameMaker Studio Standard to Professional.

I''m very excited for this deal. I took advantage of it myself for my own independent game company, [PlayPerro](http://playperro.com/ "PlayPerro").

I was planning on purchasing a new professional license before the end of the year anyway, now in total I''ve saved $75!

Be sure to get your get your [free copy of GameMaker Studio Standard](http://tobiahmarks.com/2013/11/gamemaker-studio-standard-free-limited-time/ "GameMaker Studio Standard Free for a limited time!") and <a title="Upgrade to Professional" href="https://www.yoyogames.com/checkout" target="_blank">upgrade it to GameMaker Studio Professional</a> today, before this offer goes away!
