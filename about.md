I am a Game Evangelist at <a title="Microsoft" href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a>.
  
I am a co-founder of a company called <a title="Yobonja" href="http://www.Yobonja.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yobonja</a>.
  
I also run my own independent game company called <a title="PlayPerro" href="http://www.playperro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayPerro</a>.

Let me tell you a little about myself: First off, I''m a geek.

I am passionate for programming and game development. I love prototyping new game ideas and learning new tools and techniques. Unsurprisingly, I also enjoy playing games. Not just video and computer games either. I am an avid collector of board games, card games, and pen and paper RPGs. I''m always up for a game of Settlers of Catan, Werewolves, or perhaps a night of Dungeons and Dragons or Eclipse Phase. Some of my favorite digital games are The Walking Dead, the Half Life series, and World of Warcraft.

I love to go to live performances like improv shows, concerts, and even the opera. I also enjoy cooking, target shooting, and going to theme parks.

I’ve lived in the San Francisco Bay Area my whole life. I have two Bachelors of Science degrees from <a title="Cogswell Polytechnical College" href="http://www.cogswell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cogswell Polytechnical College</a> in Sunnyvale. One in Software Engineer, focus in Game Engineering. The other in Digital Art Engineering, focus in Game Design.

After I graduated in 2009, I co-founded an independent game development company called <a title="Yobonja" href="http://www.yobonja.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yobonja</a>. Yobonja is most known for <a title="Blast Monkeys" href="http://www.yobonja.com/blast-monkeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blast Monkeys</a>, a physics based puzzle game.

I started a second company in 2012 for my solo projects called <a title="PlayPerro" href="http://www.playperro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayPerro</a>.

In August 2013, I joined <a title="Microsoft" href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a> as a Technical Evangelist.
